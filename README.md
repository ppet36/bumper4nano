# Bumper(Duino) for Arduino Nano

This is my modification of BumperDuino from Ardumower.de site for Arduino Nano instead of standalone ATMEGA328P. Some pins are remapped so modified MCU source is also available.

Original sources is available here https://github.com/Ardumower/ardumower

TODAY WORK IN PROGRESS
